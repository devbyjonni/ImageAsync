# ImageAsync

Your current code is structured well for testing. I suggest we start with testing the following core areas:

### 1. **ImagesGridViewModel Testing**
   - **Test Success with API Data:**
     Mock the `APIService` to simulate successful image loading from the API. Assert that the `images` array gets populated and `isLoading` becomes false after the fetch.
   - **Test Success with Bundle Data:**
     Mock the `APIService` to load data from the bundle (`TestImages.json`). Verify that the images from the bundle get loaded properly.
   - **Test Failure Cases:**
     Simulate failures (e.g., network errors or decoding errors) and verify that `viewModelError` is set appropriately and `isLoading` becomes false after the failure.

### 2. **APIService Testing**
   - **Test API Fetching:**
     Ensure that the `performFetch` method correctly fetches data from the API by mocking the network response and validating the expected data.
   - **Test Bundle Fetching:**
     Verify the correctness of loading from the bundle. You can mock the bundle manager to simulate bundle data retrieval.

### 3. **NetworkManager Testing**
   - **Test Network Request Execution:**
     Mock URLSession and ensure that the `performRequest` method handles successful and failed requests as expected.
   - **Test Response Validation:**
     Verify that the `validateResponse` method correctly validates HTTP responses, both successful (200-299) and error status codes.

### 4. **BundleManager Testing**
   - **Test JSON Loading:**
     Simulate JSON loading and check for correct data parsing. Also, simulate scenarios where the file is missing or corrupted and validate that appropriate errors are thrown.

Starting with these tests will cover the core logic of your app while ensuring that edge cases are handled properly.

Do you want to start with a specific test (like `ImagesGridViewModel` or `NetworkManager`) first?
